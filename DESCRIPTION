Description: This package provides functions of a workflow to identify how to optimally group species into parcels. Item parceling is a pre-modeling approach for structural equation modeling that summarizes multiple items into ideally three parcels. These parcels then serve as the indicator variables to inform a latent construct. Ecological datasets, such as microbiome data, are commonly structured as site x species community matrices. The intent of parceling a community matrix is to reduce it dimensionality, while maintaining as much as possible through optimization, important patterns of covariation. This approach is designed to investigate how microbiome composition explains an outcome variable, for example some continuous phenotype of a host that is thought to be influenced by the microbiome. Example applications we have explored include gut microbiomes predicting digestive efficiency, or wound microbiomes explaining healing time..
